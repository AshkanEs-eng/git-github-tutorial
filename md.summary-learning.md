# Summary of Learning Git & GitHub

## 1. Learned Commands
In this project, I learned and used the following Git commands:

- git init  
- git status  
- git add  
- git commit  
- git log  
- git log --oneline  
- git diff  
- git branch  
- git checkout  
- git merge  
- git fetch  
- git pull  
- git push  
- git revert  
- git rm --cached  
- git clone  

These commands helped me manage version control, track changes, and collaborate using GitHub.

## 2. Challenges Faced
Some of the challenges I faced during this project were:

- Understanding the difference between **fetch** and **pull**
- Understanding how **git rm --cached** works and why it is needed when a file is already tracked
- Understanding the difference between **local branches** and **remote branches**
- Reading and interpreting the output of **git diff** and **git log**
- Mapping Git commands to **VS Code UI actions**

## 3. Key Takeaways
The three most important things I learned are:

1. **Git tracks history through commits**, and each commit represents a snapshot of the project.
2. **Fetch downloads changes without modifying files**, while **pull downloads and merges changes** into the local branch.
3. **Pull Requests** are the correct way to merge changes in collaborative projects, especially when working with branches or forks.

## 4. Questions
Some questions I still have about Git and GitHub are:

- What is the best workflow for handling merge conflicts in large projects?
- When should rebase be preferred over merge?
- How do professional teams structure their branching strategies?
